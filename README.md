# WhazzupInTryavna
"What's up" in slang "Wazz up" in Tryavna (my hometown) is a web application that allows you to add and find any activities you like, read leatests news from town(taken from https://tryavna.bg/), 
real time chat. And that's it for my first ASP.NET Core MVC deffense project in Software University(https://softuni.bg/)
